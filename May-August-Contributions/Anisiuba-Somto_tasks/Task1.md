    _**TYHOID MEDICAL REPORT**_
- I designed an effective Data Collection design tool to record symtoms data for typhoid fever and its level of severity from a local professional,
  putting into consideration the objectives of the project.

- I designed a website using Google sites with the data collection tool embedded which I created with JOTFORM. 

- Name of website is Typhoid Medical Report
- Link to the website: https://somtee-tech.github.io/typhoidFeverSurveyForm/

- Easy usage by any local professional/practitioner, straight to the point and at a glance gathers the important information needed for the 
  typhoid app.
  
  Description of the Typhoid Medical Report Website:
  
  - A home page which gave a detailed description of the objective of the Typhoid fever survey
      - a sign up form for the medical professionals/practitioners to login with their details and name of the company they work for.
      - a link to take part in the survey which will direct you to the survey form to be filled.
- An embedded survey form created using jotform which is filled by the local professional and submitted to the required location through an email.
     - The form contains technical questions which at the end of the survey gathers information to confirm the typhoid fever diagnosis and determine 
        how severe the disease situation is
- A frequently asked questions (FAQs) of typhoid fever and the answers given.
