Introduction 
======================================================================================================================================================
Hello,

I am Manognya Dasika, an `Outreachy applicant` -2022 ‚ú®. I have designed an mobile application with the help of android studio and firebase database. Let's get deep into it. 



***This task is assigned under @stephane fadanka mentor. Thank you mentor for guiding me throught the task completion.***


Overview 
======================================================================================================================================================
## We see many-many people are not getting clarity why this typhoid diseases is spreading. Neither the doctors cannot say how the pain is and at the same time, nor the patients can.
```
Keeping in mind, I have decided to help this community by taking surveys from the users which
will help us to identify what is the actual problem ! and how can we overcome through it üî•

> THANK YOU FOR SUBIMITING THE SURVEY ‚úÖ‚úÖ


hereby, I would like to share few images with the respect to explaination.

**Front page** -

Here, I have written the reason why we need the survey. Hope that will help the end users to understand how potentially their information can help a person's life.

**Form page** -
======================================================================================================================================================

Here, the user will start filling the form.

Hence, we are at the end of the form. After filling the form, we will get the respective information using firebase database. It took me 3 and half days to connect 
android with the `Firebase` databse. There were many errors while I was going through. But, finally I got resolved the issue. Hence, I could now connect the database üéõÔ∏è

Let us now look at the working of the android application.

and after filling the form, immediately the data is stored in the firebase database.
