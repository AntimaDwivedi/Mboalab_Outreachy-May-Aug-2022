Hello,

I am manognya dasika, `an outreachy applicant` -2022. '

> **This task is assigned under @JAFSIA Elisee mentor. Thank you mentor for guiding me throught the task completion. ✨✨**

Overview 💻
=================================================================================================
We see many-many people are not getting clarity why this typhoid diseases is spreading. Neither the doctors cannot say how the pain is and at the same time, nor the patients can.



Keeping in mind, I have designed an app which could help the end users to connect through the problem and get cured. There are many features in this app. This app will gguide the end users to know about the app desire, conditions, how to run the app, how to click photos, how to upload those photos, getting help by nearby doctors arund them, getting connected with the people who can help them, calendar to mark things, notificatiion box to get messages, remainders etc.

let us know more about the features-

1️⃣ home page

2️⃣ about page ❓

3️⃣ feed page

4️⃣ chat page

5️⃣ notifications box 🔔

6️⃣ profile page

7️⃣ calendar page 📅

8️⃣ analysis page

and camera page 📷

# Details of each features -

1. home page -
the end users can go to this page ansd search for the related issues where they are facing. You can just scroll the pages. Join the communities and much more !

2. about page -
this page speaks about the Mboalab inspired mentors who worked for this project and taking this project to next level.

3. feed page -
you will get to know about what's going on in this world

4. chat page
it is basically a chat box. You can connect through this app. Ask your fellows peeps about the issues around it.

5. notifications -
This includes the messages, reminders, to do list, appointments and etc.

6. profile -
get improved and encoureaged by people

7. calendar -
get reminded things by this app

8. analysis -
this will tell you how much your health is and also how much you need energy. 

9. mainly **camera page** 📷 - This page is the main criteria of the app. Because through this image only we will be able to detect the symptoms followed by the disease.

> Here, I am would like to share the prototype of my design. Hope you like it. I have done up to my best. Any feedbacks given would be great. I would like to improve myself more.

Tools to build the app
----
- Android Studio 
- Models are build using tensorFlow Lite Model Maker and then integrated into our app (as TFLite models in this collection are compatible with ML Kit, Google's mobile SDK that makes it easy to use ML in your Android and iOS apps) or we can Google Cloud API's like [Cloud Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) or we can use  Firebase [AutoML Vision Edge](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml/automl-image-labeling) for analysis.
- we can create a local database of the patient data using SQLIte Android which is not recommended as it will increase app size so it we can use Firebase realtime Database - the data will be sync.


Device highlights
------
- High resolution camera
- Gallery (to collect the captured images.)
- Uploading images and dataform

Devices
----
- Android

Setting up the environment
------

- Android Studio
- IOS

If you are a newbie, need some guidance to install the Android Studio [click here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zx_eFyHRU0) 

- Once, downloaded, set up the installation. [click here to setup!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQTwtawsdeU)
- documentation for the same [I will guide you!](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27570516/how-to-open-an-existing-project-in-android-studio)

TensorFlow  
- [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/ml-kit/collections/image-classification/1)


# Future Plans
- image detection through scanning. Now, we are trying to detect the symptoms after taking images. also  without any storage waste, while scanning itself we can detect the symptoms.
- Any lens software so that there would be easy to scan
- Location nearby the user device. If any emergency, they need help. We can send the message to the hospitals around the location. Using radio signals we can analyze the distance. 

Conclusions
----

Herby, I would like to work and contribute more on this project. I am looking forward to improve the detection of Typhoid disease. Thanks a lot once again.
