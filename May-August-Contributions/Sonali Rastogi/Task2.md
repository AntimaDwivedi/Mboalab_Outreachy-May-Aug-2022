# **Design and Architecture of App**
*Try out the Play button in tool bar of Figma file to check out the workflow of the design prototype in full screen mode*<br>

## Refer this [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/Bm7fvnTGOCB9783Zaq7lEZ/Task2-DocReflex?node-id=0%3A1) 'Task2-DocReflex' for the proposed design and workflow of the app with a tentative modular architecture.<br>
*Note: It is a work in progress.*<br>

The app is called ***DocReflex*** to signify the objective behind this app as a diagnostic tool, which will resemble the doctor's reflexes, and recommend the best possible diagnosis. The underlying workflow of the app will be updated with an intensive research study and recommendations from medical experts on the impact of a series of symptoms on the severity of the disease of the patient. If integrated with the methodology proposed in Task1, a real time survey/questionnaire filled by the user can be integrated with EDC to provide the best possible diagnosis. Furthermore, various features from existing diagnostic mobile applications can be studied to identify the best medical practices and features that can be provided to the user.

# **Project Timeline**

***Estimated Timeline for Project Implementation*** (*Total duration* = 11 weeks.)
## 1. Ideation and Medical Research <-> *2 weeks*
**Description** : The main objective of this application is making smartphones, i.e., an mobile application, an affordable yet effective solution in diagnosing Typhoid fever. The initial stage of this app development will involve research of existing studies on symptoms and collecting reviews of medical experts on their relevance with severity of the disease. If integrated with the methodology proposed in Task1, the same research results can be utislised in the app development.

## 2. Designing a Prototype <-> *1 week*
**Description** : The next step will be shaping the first visuals of the app. It will include finalizing the styles(app design), workflow and the key features of the app. This prototype will be referred throughout the next development and testing stage. Hence, it will require documentation and wireframing of final design.

## 3. Development and Testing <-> *4 weeks*
**Description** : The next phase will start the actual development of the app. It usually involves Frontend Designs and Backend Integration as follows:
A. *Frontend development*:
- Develop app screens.
- Clickable buttons.
- Navigation pages.
- Integration with backend processes.
B. *Backend development*:
- Data Storage & Retrieval.
- Backend Server & Database Management.
Testing of the app will be conducted simultaneously with app development. Bugs, errors can be identified and corrected at this stage. The app will go through several tests and quality assurance guidelines. This stage will finally help in determining the feasibility of the app.

## 4. Prototype for a Touch Experience <-> *1 week*
**Description** : A prototype of the app is usually built at this stage, and it is given to users, so that they use it, just as the end consumers would do, and give the necessary feedback. This stage is the first stage where the app design takes shape in the minds of the consumers, and they actually can use the app. Their feedback will be used in fine-tuning the app with regards to:
- Interfaces and Platforms.
- Testing on various screen resolutions and sizes.
- Buttons and navigation.
- Privacy of user data.
- App platforms.
- Beta testing.

## 5. Coding and Design <-> *1 week*
**Description** : After testing the app with users, the next stage is to do the actual coding and provide the UX (User Experience) interface of the app. It will involve developing the interfaces of the app, its screens, buttons, links, and other design elements by keeping the end-user in focus.

## 6. Testing of App <-> *1 week*
**Description** : It will involve testing the app for its functionality, ease of use, interface design, UX layout, and user experience of utilizing the app. We can conduct User Acceptance Testing or Beta Testing depending on the availability of resources.

## 7. Publishing the App <-> *1 week*
**Description** : Lastly, the app will be approved for final launch. We can publish the app in online mobile app stores like App Store (Apple Inc.), and Google Play Store (Android) by following certain guidelines and consent to their terms and conditions.

# **Additional Information**
Time is a constraint to implement a detailed app architecture, and hence it is still a work in progress. 
I will be updating and styling these [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/files/project/54673446/Team-project?fuid=1019710383222981085) files with better features and interfaces.
Kindly share your reviews and ideas on the proposed plan and I would be grateful to collaborate for upgrading any possible aspect of this project. <br>
I am enthusiastic about any kind of contribution to this spectacular initiative by MboaLab, and would like to make this proposal into a real life project during the internship.
