# **Proposed Logo Design** 
This is an image of the proposed [Logo Design](./Pictures/Sonali-MboaLabLogo.jpeg) for MboaLab. <br>
<img src="May-August-Contributions\Sonali Rastogi\Pictures\Sonali-MboaLabLogo.jpeg"><br><br>
Each component of the logo was designed with an aim to symbolize the objectives of MboaLab. The blue-green theme is used for visual balance, and a soothing and relaxing influence, as the colour signifies growth, renewal and health. The background image represents the integrated community platform offered by MboaLab, and the slogan of the community is placed in a circular fashion to represent continuous sustained efforts of the community. The arrows at top and bottom of the logo signifies the catalysed forward development. The font style used is "Orbitron" which signifies a futuristic approach. Lastly, the entire logo design is intricated in square shape to represent an equal integration in the community for sharing knowledge.   <br><br>

# **Design Prototype**
*Try out the Play button in tool bar of Figma file to check out the workflow of the design protytype of website in full screen mode*<br>

## Refer this [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/mBXjG4GyifenaTJHMnd9IU/MboaLab-Website-DesignProposal?node-id=0%3A1) 'MboaLab-Website-DesignProposal' for the proposed design and workflow of the website with a tentative modular architecture.<br>
*Note: It is a work in progress.*<br>
The proposed innovative and various industrially popular features can be studied and integrated with the website with the best UI-UX design. Each theme and styling has been designed in order to highlight the objectives of MboaLab. 
<br><br>

# **Implementation Cost**
The following factors will directly contribute to the final implementation cost of the website:
- Domain registration
- Hosting
- Design
- Copywriting
- SEO <br>

Optional factors that might contribute to the implementation cost of the website:
- Themes
- Plugins
- CDN
- Security Suite<br>

The total implementation cost can be determined by structuring the best possible combination of available services(like: Firebase hosting, Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, AWS offers website hosting services) and resources to meet the needs of this platform to carry out all the aforemetioned tasks in the least possible cost. Furthermore, maintenance of website can also be a key factor in cost estimate.

# **Tools and Frameworks**
MERN stack is a very popular tool used in industry to develop attractive, responsive, secured, fastly accessible, and easily browsable websites by integrating certaing standard practices like using:
- Bootstrap for enhancing the styling and responsiveness of the website,
- Https enabled/encryption for securing the server
- Server side rendering and SEO using Next.js, for improving accessibility and making it more browsable.<br>
<br>

# **Additional Information**
Time is a constraint to implement a detailed website prototype, and hence it is still a work in progress. 
I will be updating and styling the [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/files/project/54673446/Team-project?fuid=1019710383222981085) files with better features and interfaces.
Kindly share your reviews and ideas on the proposed plan and I would be grateful to collaborate for upgrading any possible aspect of this project. <br>
I am enthusiastic about any kind of contribution to this spectacular initiative by MboaLab, and would like to make this proposal into a real life project during the internship.
