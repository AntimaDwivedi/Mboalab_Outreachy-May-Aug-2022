# **Starter Task 0: Get Started with Open-Source Contribution**

## Greetings Spectators! 

### Hello, I am **Sonali Rastogi, a prospective Outreachy intern from India.**
I like to introduce myself as a passionate innovator and a dedicated individual possessing teamwork experience and a drive to learn and acquire new skills, looking for opportunities to work on the most cutting-edge technologies and to contribute in the value addition of the domain.

I am a junior undergrad student in National Institute of Technology Agartala, India and have been working as a ***social innovator*** and an aspiring STEM ***researcher*** with an objective to create a positive impact with sustainable development in the world. I have been awarded by several national initiatives for nurturing and connecting young innovators like me. My latest endeavour is being accepted into the upcoming *Unleash Hacks Canada*, aiming to propose solutions for developing safe and inclusive public spaces and services, and ultimately contributing to ***United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals***. Furthermore, I have been trying to contribute to the social welfare for African countries.

I am very glad to find this spectacular ***MboaLab*** community in Outreachy and excited to learn and collaborate with this open and collaborative space with resonating objectives to create innovative solutions for health, economic and social needs of the community. I am enthusiastic about this dynamic social initiative to improve and upgrade the existing conventional diagnostic tools for typhoid fever, a global disease burden to public health, as coined by WHO, and will be contributing my best to this community in any possible aspect. 

This is my introduction and very *first Open Source contribution* for the assigned Starter Task 0. 
Creating this very first file and getting started with Open Source was indeed an intimidating task but it turned out to be a great investment of my time considering the seamless opportunities and targeted social benefit offered by this community and Open Source contributions. 

I am looking forward to connect with the brightest minds associated with this community and discuss my ideas in the the further assigned Advanced [Task 1](./Task1.md), [Task 2](./Task2.md) and the [Additional Task](./AdditionalTask.md). Kindly recommend your views on improving these ideas and making them more detail oriented.
