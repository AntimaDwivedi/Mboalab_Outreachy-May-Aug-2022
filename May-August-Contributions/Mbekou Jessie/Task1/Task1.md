#Task 1: Design a Data collection tool to record symptoms Data


###Objectives:
Our project is based on the use of a mix model combining AI systems and software tools with human clinical data acquire through a Data collection system. The objective of this task is to design the data collection system that will be use to collect thyphoid fever clinical data (symptoma variables that will allow us not only to confirm the diagnosis but above all to determine the level of severity of the disease).


### Tool Used:
I used Adobe XD (a  powerful UI/UX design solution for websites, apps & more) to design a form based on the requirements given. 


### Description:
The designed tool is addressed to health care professionals and takes into consideration language barriers as one can select his/her preferred language.
The form contains a variety of symptoms classified into 2: main symptoms and severe cases.


####The main symptoms
These symptoms are a list of all possible symptoms a patient suffering from typhoid is most likely to have.
Here, the medical personnel will choose the most common amongst the different options and only a patient with the combination of selected symptoms is expected to have typhoid.
For example; a patient having stomach pains and headache is not necessarily suffering from typhoid.
On the other hand, a patient with a combination high fever, vomiting, abdominal pains is most likely suffering from typhoid. 

####The severe cases
Here are the different symptoms to determine how severe the disease is in a patient. Once a patient is successfully diagnosed with typhoid, additional symptoms from this list determines the severity of the disease.
The more the symptoms, the more severe the disease. The health care professionals will choose the symptoms in order of ascending severity.

#####NB: This form can be implemented on a website as well as with a data collection tool like jotform and can also be implemented on a mobile app. The data collected from the form can be used as dataset. A screenshot of the form has been added to my Pull Request.
