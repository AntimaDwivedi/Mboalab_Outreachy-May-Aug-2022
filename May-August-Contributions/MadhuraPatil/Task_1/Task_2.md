# Task 2: Design of an app for the project based on the malaria Screener model

I have created a design for the mobile application using the tool Figma for diagnostic of typhoid fever integrating features for wide and easy adoption and use.

•	Here data can be collected from user which can be further worked upon classification models to predict illness from the symptoms.

•	There is different mode for professionals to access all the data to analyze and predict the results.

•	Moreover , high quality camera can be used to capture the widal test data to predicts the reports.
