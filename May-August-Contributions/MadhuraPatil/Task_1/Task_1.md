# Task 1: Design a Data collection tool to record symptoms Data.

For this task I have created a google form to collect the data. I have chosen this tool because: 
•	It is a free online tool, that allows you to collect information easily and efficiently.
•	To use this tool,  you only need a Google account, the same one you need to access Gmail, YouTube or Google Drive. Hence , it can be easily accessed by anyone with internet
•	The interface is very easy to use. Any user with an average Internet knowledge can submit their records.
•	Google forms stores the feedback received so we can analyze it in detail.
•	The forms are integrated with Google spreadsheets therefore we can access to a spreadsheet view of the collected data which can be shared with local health care professionals and practitioners according to the respondent’s region submitted by them for further study.
•	The general configuration of forms or surveys allows you to collect the recipient’s email address and limit the answers.
•	We can send the form by email, integrate it into our website using iframe ,etc or send the link via social networks or any other means.
•	With this tool, you can get unlimited questions and answers at no cost, while other survey tools require a payment depending on the number of questions and recipients

### Here’s the link to the form :

In this form a single person can record the data of all the family members i.e  all the data of a particular household can be collected at a single time through a single login. Also for every symptom the respondent has to record the severity and the duration to obtain a precise data and henc,e more accurate results.
