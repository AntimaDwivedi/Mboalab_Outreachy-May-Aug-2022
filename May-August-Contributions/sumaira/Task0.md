2). Run the command

“ git clone

https://github.com/Mboalab/Mboalab\_Outreachy-May-Aug-2022.git”

in your CLI / github desktop app / or IDE. This command is used only
once, no repetition is needed.

3). Set origin using the command

“git remote add origin your\_github\_addr”

4). Set upstream using the command

“git remote add upstream mboalab\_lab\_addr”

5). Make a new branch using the command

“git branch your\_branch\_name”.

6). Or create a branch and check out to your new branch using a single
command

“git checkout –b your\_branch\_name”.

7). Do your coding.

8). Push your code to your github, which is origin using the command

“git push origin your\_branch\_name”.

9). Pull a pr.

10). When the upstream/Mboalab repo changes. You should first checkout
to the main/master branch and then either make a pull request directly
from the upstream/Mboalab.

11). OR update your own origin/your\_github main branch by clicking the
fetch upstream button.

12). Then make a pull request from your own origin/your\_github.

13). If there are conflicts resolve them by adding / removing the lines
in the code.

14). Once you are done make a new branch and checkout to that branch.
And then code.

Apart from this I too don’t like conflicts as some time they make my
branch unusable.
