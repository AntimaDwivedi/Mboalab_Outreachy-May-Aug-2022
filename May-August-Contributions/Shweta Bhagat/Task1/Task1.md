### Objective 
The objective of this task is to design the data collection system that will be use to collect thyphoid fever clinical data (symptoma variables that will allow us not only to confirm the diagnosis but above all to determine the level of severity of the disease).

- I have created a Google Form to collect the typhoid clinical data in response to task 1.
- I have added all mentors as collaborators. I would appreciate any feedback especially if the form needs improvement.
