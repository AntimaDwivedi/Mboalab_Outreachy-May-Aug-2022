# Task 1
# Design a Data collection tool to record symptoms Data

## Objective

The objective of this task is to design the data collection system that will be use to collect thyphoid fever clinical data (symptoma variables that will allow us not only to confirm the diagnosis but above all to determine the level of severity of the disease).


**I have designed the following data collection tool for the Task 1.**

### 1. Google Survey Form

I have created a google survey form as it can record as many responses as required and also the number of questions that I can add to it is not limited to certain number. We can also convert our recorded responses to google sheets for proper analysis.

The survey for typhoid fever diagnosis contains the following sections:
* Section 1 asks questions regarding the personal details like age, gender of the candidate so that we get to know which section of the population is most affected by typhoid fever.
* Section 2 asks the question regarding symptoms which gives us an insight into candidate’s illness details.
* Section 3 and 4 asks questions regarding the treatment which tells us if the received treatment was fruitful or not.
* Section 5 asks questions regarding the severe cases.
* Section 6 asks questions regarding the cause of illness like if the candidate got the illness from someone close. As “Prevention is better than cure”, this section can help us in spreading more awareness and help fighting the disease before it can spread to more people.
* Section 7 asks questions about how aware the patient is about typhoid fever.

Also, we can work on converting the survey questions in local languages which will help people in understanding the survey questions easily and motivate more people to record their responses.

### 2. Chatbot

I have also designed the questions using a chatbot with help of Form to chatbot which we can develop and embed later in Mboalab android or web application as this will be more user friendly in collecting the data from the candidates.

### 3. QR Code

Also, I have converted the link of the survey in QR code so that the form gets easily available to the participants by just scanning the QR code.
