INTRODUCTION:

Every year, up to two hundred thousand people in the world die from Typhoid Fever. One of the reasons may be the inability of people to detect the fever in their body. 

The aim of this application is to provide an easy and efficient means of Typhoid Fever detection in the body. The idea is to utilize the high-resolution camera and powerful computing power of modern smartphones to screen blood smear images automatically for parasites and infected red blood cells. Malaria Screener combines image acquisition, smear image analysis, and result visualization in its slide screening process, and is equipped with a database to give both app-users and researchers easy access to the acquired data. 

FEATURES:

1. Capture smear images with phone camera
2. Parasite detection (Thin smear: identify infected red blood cells, Thick smear: identify parasites)
3. Local database and image gallery for the user to access old data.
4. Upload images and metadata from each session to user's Box repository.

DEVICE COMPACTIBILITY:
1. Android
2. IOS

IMPLEMENTATION:

The Typhoid Fever Screener Application was designed using figma design application. The design will then be imported into an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code as a Flutter app. In order to import the design as a Flutter application, the Flutter Development Environment must have been correctly installed and set up on your system. Use link:  [Download Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install?gclid=Cj0KCQjwgYSTBhDKARIsAB8KukuwszjBBMHyUOlptKyrwfN00_-bb5edkIiWgtbv55Kl0_RdPJBKhqAaAnXvEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) to download flutter and follow the steps in link: [Full Flutter Installation](https://radixweb.com/blog/install-flutter-on-windows-mac-and-android) on how to setup flutter on your system
After flutter has been set-up, program the code required to implement the Typhoid Fever Application.
