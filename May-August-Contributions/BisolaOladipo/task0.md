Hi Everyone :) I am Bisola from Nigeria. I graduated with a Computer Science degree from Babcock University. I am excited about Mboalab and the work they do to help the global community. I have learnt so much from the tasks especially how to do certain things on git such as forking, cloning, and many more!

Check out my other tasks!

I also appreciate the mentors for making the process easy and other applicants for the great team spirit.
