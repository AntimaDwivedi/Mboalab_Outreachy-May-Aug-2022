What is Typhoid Fever?

Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection that can spread throughout the body, affecting many organs. Without prompt treatment, it can cause serious complications and can be fatal. It's caused by a bacterium called Salmonella typhi, which is related to the bacteria that cause salmonella food poisoning. (by NHS)

I have designed an online platform that will aid the diagnosis of Typhoid Fever.
This tool is addressed to healthcare professionals in order for them to collect patients data and provide necessary treatments based on the severity of the Typhoid Fever in patients.

Diagnosis Steps: 
1. Register Patient: 
this step collects personal information about the patient including: Name, Age, Sex, Phone Number, Email and Address. This allows healthcare professionals to keep record of every patient and can be very helful for future purposes.

2. Patient Symptoms:
this step allows the healthcare professionals to identify the symptoms each patient may be experiencing and the severity of the symptom. A "Typhoid Severity" button that shows how serious the fever is in the patient's body is also included. This is very helful in providing treament for the patient. Please note that each symptom listed was gotten from the NHS website on typhoid fever.

3. Give a Feedback:
the main aim of this step is to get significant feedback in order to improve the Typhoid Diagnosis Tool. There is always room for improvement!
