Task 2: Design of a Mobile an app for the project based on the malaria Screener model 

Objective: To develop a design methodology with specific list of tasks and descriptions, including 
technical detail and tools to be used on the various stpes involved in the development of an app 
following the Malaria screener model.

Solution: I created a google document and added the mails of the mentors as editors of the document.
I used google docs because I believe it's easier to use as everyone has an email address already and 
for timely delivery as noted and it ensures security as access to sensitive information such as this 
can be restricted to private eyes only. 
Moreover, google docs affords the opportunity for review, suggestions, and controlling the number of
people with editing status. For example, I updated the document to afford commenting by anyone who visits 
the site.

The google link to the document is https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YHS_c33JgP52xbROXtR7YYUfLHQRqNc40v6_HOvLy5I/edit?usp=sharing 

Technical Documentation Summary:
I first went through the overview of what the document entails in the overview section then proceeded with the 
design considerations of the various problems that led to the development of the project and the need for the project.

Followed by the goals we are hoping to accomplish by designing this project and the constraints.

Next, the developmental methods- Agile in this case and the reasons behind it; the architectural strategies, mobile 
development strategies and the detailed list of tasks to be performed developed as a result of the malaria screener app
and the architecture strategies.

Enormous thanks to Outreachy and Mboalab for the opportunity given to contribute my quota thus far to this project. 
It's been my pleasure.
