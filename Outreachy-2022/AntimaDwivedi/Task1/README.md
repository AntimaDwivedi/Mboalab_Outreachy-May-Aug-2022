# Task 1: Design a Data collection tool to record symptoms Data 

## My Proposed Idea:
I have made an online platform to record the basic information and symptoms associated with a patient.The basic information include <b>name</b>,<b>age</b>,<b>Mobile number</b> and <b>gender</b>.
All the symptoms taken into consideration are based on a reasearch named  [A Machine Learning Approach to Clinical Diagnosis of Typhoid Fever](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190320358.pdf) published in 
International Journal of Computer and Information Technology (ISSN: 2279 – 0764) Volume 02– Issue 04, July 2013.The UI of online platform will be lool like this:<br>

<b>This tool is available in  more than 100 languages,so that it can be used worldwide</b>

There are total  eighteen symptoms  and each symptom has three values(Low, High and Default), in which a patient must select one according to the
patient’s feelings. Default exists for symptom not perceived by the patients.

<br><br><br>
After the selection of all the symptoms, submission is made to the designed system by clicking submit button and this click saves all the marked symptoms in a sheet.

<b>Know your Result tab</b> also present in the web page which is responsible to shgow  the degree of severity  along the classes- Very Low, Low, Moderate, High and Very High.
