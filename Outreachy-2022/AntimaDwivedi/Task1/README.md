# Task 1: Design a Data collection tool to record symptoms Data 

## My Proposed Idea:
I have made an online platform to record the basic information and symptoms associated with a patient.The basic information include <b>name</b>,<b>age</b>,<b>Mobile number</b> and <b>gender</b>.
All the symptoms taken into consideration are based on a reasearch named  [A Machine Learning Approach to Clinical Diagnosis of Typhoid Fever](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190320358.pdf) published in 
International Journal of Computer and Information Technology (ISSN: 2279 – 0764) Volume 02– Issue 04, July 2013.The UI of online platform will be lool like this:<br>
There are total  eighteen symptoms ( conditional attributes) and each symptom has three values(Low, High and Default), in which a patient must select one according to the
patient’s feelings. Default exists for symptom not perceived by the patients. After the selection of all the symptoms, submission is made to the designed system by clicking submit
button and this takes the user to the view result interface.If typhoid fever
is diagnosed, the degree of severity is displayed along the
disease name,For the decision atribute,
there are five classes- Very Low, Low, Moderate, High and
Very High.
