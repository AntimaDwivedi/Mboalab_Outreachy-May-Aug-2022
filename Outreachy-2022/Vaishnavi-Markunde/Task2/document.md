The objective of this task is to come up and design a step by step methodology to develo a similar app keeping the same feature and fonctionalities but applied to typhoid fever diagnostic.

Note: The focus of the task is just to design a methodology with specific list of tasks and descriptions, including technical detail and tools to be used, on the various steps involved in the development of an app folowing the malaria screener model.
Tools and Skills:
This task is addressed to applicants with interest in the area of data science, programming and coding, Technical documentation, all interested applicant willing to contribute to the project, Partcipants having skills in web and front end developement and other deemed relevant competencies.

Main tasks to complete:
Check in detail Malaria Screener project
Create a technical document with detailled list of tasks, description, tools needed to develop a similar app
Start completing some tasks (Contributors should limit themselves to achievable tasks within contribution period timeline)


# Typhoid Fever 
<br>



**Abstract** : Typhoid fever is an acute illness associated with fever caused by the Salmonella typhil bacteria. It can also be caused by Salmonella paratyphi, a related bacterium that usually causes less several illnesses. The bacteria are deposited in water or food by a human carrier and are then spread to other people in the area. Typhoid fever is a global health problem. Its real impact is difficult to estimate because the clinical picture is confused with those of many other febrile infections. It has been estimated that approximately 17 million cases of typhoid fever and 600,000.00 associated deaths occur annually. Typhoid fever also has a very high social and economic impact because of the hospitalization of patients with acute disease and the implications and loss of income attributable to the duration of the clinical illness(s). Typhoid fever affects more than 13 million people annually, with over 500,000 patients dying of the disease. Typhoid fever constitutes a serious public health problem in many parts of the world

## Diagnosis :

### Tasks:
<br>
1. Collect data from users and medical practioners.<br>
2. Data preprocessing. <br>
3. Classify the data into different classes. <br>
4. Divide the collected dataset into training data and test data. <br>
5. Create a model to study the training data. <br>
6. Test the model.


### Description :

**1. Collection of Data**<br>
    The app asks the user various questions regarding user's symptoms and the level of severity of those symptoms.
    <br>
    The following is the list of few symptoms (conditional attributes) that our app will ask the user 
    <br>
    
- Fever  
- Abdominal Pain  
- Cough
- Diarrhoea
- Constipation
- Muscle weakness
- Headache
- Skin rash
- Weightless
- Stomach Distension
- Blood occult in stool
    
    
    If the user has any of these symptoms there would be a prompt that asks the user about severity of the symptom i.e Low or High. On the basis of these symptoms ,       typhoid would be diagonised. Another precise way for diagnosing typhoid is by collecting widal tests results from the user and based on those results  (agglutination) typhoid would results(agglutination) typhoid would be diagnosed.
    
   <br>
   
**2. Data preprocessing** 

Data collected from the user would be cleaned first ( dealing with missing data). 
To make the programming easier and the program more efficient, these values would be converted to integer since it is easier to work around with numbers.
For conditional attributes we shall assign 0 for default 1 for low and 2 for high.
The output for training data would be the level of typhoid , we would assign 1 for very low , 2 for low , 3 for moderate , 4 for high and 5 for very high.

<br>

**3. Classification of Data**

The data has to be classified into 5 classes depending upon the severity of the typhoid fever.

**4. Dividing the dataset**
We would then divide the dataset into training and test data for the training the machine learning model.

**5. Machine Learning Model**
