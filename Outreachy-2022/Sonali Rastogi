## Greetings Spectators!

### Hello, I am Sonali Rastogi, a prospective Outreachy intern from India.
I am a junior undergrad student in National Institute of Technology Agartala, India and have been working as a social innovator and an aspiring researcher with an objective to create a positive impact in the world. 
I have also been awarded for several national level initiatives to nurture young innovators like me. 
I like to introduce myself as a passionate innovator and a dedicated individual possessing teamwork experience and a drive to learn and acquire new skills, looking for 
opportunities to work on the most cutting-edge technologies and to contribute in the value addition of the domain.

I am very curious and excited to learn and collaborate with this spectacular MboaLab community with resonating objectives.
